# Predicting-Global-Trade-Patterns
This project focuses on building a predictive model to forecast global trade patterns using H2O's deep learning capabilities. By leveraging historical export data from the US Census Bureau, the model aims to predict monthly export values. The project includes steps for data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the results. The ultimate goal is to enhance decision-making in global trade through accurate predictions and insights derived from the model.
